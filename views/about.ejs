    <h1>About SmartClinic</h1>

    <p>
        SmartClinic is an online clinic management system that allows patients and clinic staff to manage appointments in one place. The website is designed to make booking, viewing, and managing appointments simple and clear for everyone involved.
    </p>

    <p>
        Patients can register for an account, log in, and book appointments with available clinic staff. Once logged in, patients can view their upcoming appointments, see past appointments, and manage their bookings. This helps patients keep track of their visits and communicate clearly with the clinic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Clinic staff have access to tools that help them manage patient care. Staff can view scheduled appointments, update appointment statuses, and view patient profiles. Staff members can also add notes to patient records, allowing important information to be stored securely and accessed when needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The website includes clear navigation pages such as the home page, about page, login and registration pages, and separate dashboards for patients and staff. Search and filtering features allow users to quickly find relevant appointments or patient information.
    </p>

    <p>
        SmartClinic aims to improve organisation, reduce manual booking processes, and provide a clear overview of clinic activity for both patients and staff.
